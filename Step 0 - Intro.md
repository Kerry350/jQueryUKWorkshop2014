Hi, 

I'm Kerry, I currently work full-time for Blooie and co-run Bear & Owl. 

I'm one of those "accidental developers". I love gaming, animals (I own a lot of rats and rabbits) and I'm currently trying, and failing, to learn to play the guitar.

Today we're going to take a whirlwind tour of some of the components that make up a WYSIWYG editor. This isn't the only way to do so, just one of many. We have 1.5 hours to play with, in this time we should be able to create a functional editor. I am no expert in this (please don't leave), but I've learnt a lot whilst building Forger.js.  

I'll be around at the after-party, and contactable on Twitter as @Kerry350, if anyone has any questions that are unanswered after this workshop...or if you just want to chat :)  

# Workshop notes

* Nobody likes people towering behind them when they're figuring stuff out, if you need help feel free to shout out / pop a hand up and I'll come over. 
* I've provided a 'spoilers' section in each steps Markdown document which provides a working solution to the task at hand. Try not to look at this first though, as it defeats the purpose.
* We're going to deal with modern browsers today that support modern features such as `classList`. oldIE would need some extra lovin'.
