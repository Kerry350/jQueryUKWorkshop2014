We've had a little look at Selections and Ranges. Lets set ourselves up to build a lightweight, but functional, editor of our own. 

* Open up the index.html file in your browser, this is where we'll be checking what we build.
* This index.html file is linked to a css file (`editor.css`). I am no designer, so I apologise for the looks. 
* It's also linked to `editor.js`, this is where we'll be putting the code for our editor.

I've set some bits and pieces up, mainly the toolbar HTML and a skeleton constructor / prototype for the editor's JavaScript. 

I've kept things dead simple to make this as accessible as possible to people.
